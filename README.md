# Desktop App Usage Tracker

This is a simple desktop application that tracks the active application usage on your computer.  
Once you run the `.exe` file, it monitors which application is currently in use and records the following details for each app:

- **Start Time:** When you started using the app  
- **End Time:** When you stopped using the app  
- **Total Time:** The total duration you spent on the app  

---

## Features

- Tracks active window/application in real-time  
- Logs start time, end time, and total usage time for each app session  
- Easy to run executable file (`.exe`), no installation required  

---

## How to Use

1. Download or build the `.exe` file.  
2. Run the `.exe` by double-clicking it.  
3. The app will start tracking the usage of the foreground applications automatically.  
4. Usage data (start, end, total time) will be recorded and saved (check the program's directory for output files).

---

## Requirements

- Windows OS (because it uses Windows-specific APIs)  
- No additional dependencies needed when using the `.exe` version  

---

## Notes

- Make sure to run the `.exe` with appropriate permissions if you want accurate tracking.  
- The program tracks only the active foreground window. Background apps are not tracked.
